** Setting Up Cypress Automation on a New Device**

This guide outlines the steps to set up Cypress automation from a GitHub repository on a new device.

**Prerequisites**

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your device:

Node.js: Download and install the latest LTS version.

Git: Install Git for cloning the repository.

A text editor or IDE (e.g., VS Code) for managing the project.

**Steps to Set Up Cypress**

1. Clone the GitHub Repository

Open a terminal or command prompt.

Navigate to the directory where you want to clone the repository.

Run the following command:

git clone <repository-url>

Replace <repository-url> with the URL of your GitHub repository.

2. Navigate to the Project Directory

Move into the cloned repository:

cd <repository-folder>

Replace <repository-folder> with the name of your project folder.

3. Install Project Dependencies

Install all necessary packages using npm:

npm install

This command reads the package.json file and installs all dependencies, including Cypress.

4. Open Cypress

Run the following command to open the Cypress Test Runner:

npx cypress open

Alternatively, run tests directly in the terminal:

npx cypress run

Project Structure

Below is a typical Cypress project structure:

.
├── cypress/
│   ├── e2e/                # End-to-end tests
│   ├── fixtures/           # Test data files
│   ├── support/            # Helper functions and commands
├── node_modules/           # Installed dependencies
├── .gitignore              # Ignored files and folders for Git
├── cypress.config.js       # Cypress configuration file
├── package.json            # Project metadata and dependencies
├── package-lock.json       # Lock file for installed packages

Running Tests

Run All Tests

To run all tests in the terminal:

npx cypress run

Run Specific Test File

To run a specific test file:

npx cypress run --spec "cypress/e2e/<test-file>.cy.js"

Replace <test-file> with the name of your test file.

Run Tests in a Specific Browser

Specify the browser for running tests:

npx cypress run --browser chrome

Replace chrome with your desired browser (e.g., firefox, edge).

Common Commands

Update Dependencies

To ensure all dependencies are up-to-date:

npm update

Install Cypress Globally (Optional)

Install Cypress globally on your device:

npm install -g cypress

Configure Environment Variables

Store sensitive data or environment-specific configurations in a .env file. Install the dotenv package to use it:

npm install dotenv

Add .env to your .gitignore file to prevent sensitive data from being pushed to GitHub.

Troubleshooting

"Command not found" Errors

Ensure Node.js and npm are correctly installed and added to your system's PATH.

Dependency Issues

Delete node_modules and package-lock.json, then reinstall dependencies:

rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
npm install

Cypress Not Opening

Ensure you have sufficient permissions and that all dependencies are installed. Run:

npx cypress verify
